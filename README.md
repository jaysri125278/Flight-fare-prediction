# Flight Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting flight prices based on various factors such as the airline, journey date, source and destination, duration, and other related information. The aim is to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast flight fares given these inputs.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in an Excel file (`Data_Train.xlsx`) and includes the following columns:
- `Airline`: The name of the airline.
- `Date_of_Journey`: The date of the flight journey.
- `Source`: The source location from where the flight departs.
- `Destination`: The destination location where the flight arrives.
- `Route`: The route taken by the flight.
- `Dep_Time`: The departure time of the flight.
- `Arrival_Time`: The arrival time of the flight.
- `Duration`: The duration of the flight.
- `Total_Stops`: The total number of stops between source and destination.
- `Additional_Info`: Any additional information about the flight.
- `Price`: The target variable, representing the price of the flight.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic approach to predicting flight prices using a structured dataset. Through careful data preprocessing and exploration, a predictive model can be built to estimate the cost of flights based on various features.
